The codes introduce a reliability-based design optimization method by QS2-AGP. The codes are based on the paper "Kim J and Song J 2021" published at Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing. The paper’s full reference information is as follows:

Kim, J., and J. Song (2021). Quantile surrogates and sensitivity by adaptive Gaussian process for efficient reliability-based design optimization. Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing. Vol. 161, 107962.
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymssp.2021.107962

To implement Gaussian process model, GPML and NIGP in MATLAB are utilized.
For more information of GPML toolbox, please refer "Gaussian Process for Machine Learning (Rasmussen, C.E., and C.K.I. Williams, 2006)" and http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/. 
For more information of NIGP codes, please refer "Gaussian Process Training with Input Noise (McHutchon, A., and Rasmussen, C.E., 2011)" and http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/?portfolio=andrew-mchutchon.

The main file of the code is 'QS2_AGP_main.m', and run this code after installing GPML toolbox
